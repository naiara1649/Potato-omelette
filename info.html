            <h2>Where does potato omelette come from?</h2>
            <p>Apparently, in 1519 the egg omelette was already known , but it is not until 1817 that the first document that refers to the potato omelette appears. A legend said that the general Tomás de Zumalacárregui, during the siege of Bilbao, invented the potato omelette as a fast and nutritious dish for his hungry soldiers.</p>

            <h2>What do the Spanish call a Spanish omelette?</h2>
            <p>Known in English as Spanish omelet, this popular collation is also called tortilla española or tortilla de patata (potato omelet) in Spanish, because of its origin and its main ingredient. A traditional Spanish tortilla is basically a potato omelet, so you need eggs, potatoes, and onion, plus some oil and salt.</p>
    
            <h2>What is the difference between Spanish and French omelette?</h2>
            <p>The Spanish omelette, also known as “tortilla de patata” is cooked with potatoes. Some add onion, some don't, that is still an issue widely and passionately discussed. The regular omelette is cooked just with eggs, no potatoes, and we call it “tortilla francesa” (French omelette).
